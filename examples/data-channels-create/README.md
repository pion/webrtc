# data-channels-create
data-channels-create is a Pion WebRTC application that shows how you can send/recv DataChannel messages from a web browser. The difference with the data-channels example is that the datachannel is initialized from the pion side in this example.

## Instructions
### Download data-channels-create
```
go get github.com/pion/webrtc/examples/data-channels-create
```

### Open data-channels-create example page
[jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/swgxrp94/20/)

### Run data-channels-create
Just run run `data-channels-create`.

### Input data-channels-create's SessionDescription into your browser
Copy the text that `data-channels-create` just emitted and copy into first text area of the jsfiddle.

### Hit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle
Hit the 'Start Session' button in the browser. You should see `have-remote-offer` below the `Send Message` button.

### Input browser's SessionDescription into data-channels-create
Meanwhile text has appeared in the second text area of the jsfiddle. Copy the text and paste it into `data-channels-create` and hit ENTER.
In the browser you'll now see `connected` as the connection is created. If everything worked you should see `New DataChannel data`.

Now you can put whatever you want in the `Message` textarea, and when you hit `Send Message` it should appear in your browser!

You can also type in your terminal, and when you hit enter it will appear in your web browser.

Congrats, you have used Pion WebRTC! Now start building something cool
